## 5. Installation

**a. Set up Controler on the network**

A new controller must first be integrated on the smartphone with the associated APP in your network. Only after the first setup is the controller recognized by the Doscover module.

```
TIP
Since the Wifi devices I know only support the 2G Wifi you have to set up the first time
Pay attention to the following with the Andoid / Apple APP:
If the 2G + 5G Wifi radio on the same SID should the 5G during the setup on the router
be disabled because otherwise there may be problems recognizing or setting up the Wifi device.
After setup, the 5G can easily be activated on the router again.
```

** b. Installing via Modules instance **

Open IP Symcon's web console with _http://{IP-Symcon IP}:3777/console/_

Then the object tree _Open_.

![Object Tree](img/objectbaum.png?raw=true "Object Tree")

The instance 'Modules' below core instances in the object tree of IP-Symcon (> = Ver 5.x) with a doubleclick _Open_

![Object tree](img/object_tree.png?raw=true "Object tree")

and press the plus sign.

![Plus](img/plus.png?raw=true "Plus")
	
![ModulURL](img/add_module.png?raw=true "Add Module")

Enter the following modules URL in the field and confirm with _OK_:

```
https://github.com/softbar/MagicHomeWifiLED 
```

Then an entry for the module appears in the list of the instance _Modules_

By default, the branch _master_ is loaded, which contains current changes and adjustments.
Only the _master_ branch is kept current.

![Master](img/master.png?raw=true "master") 

**c. Setting up the modules**

In IP Symcon, first right-click **Discovery Instances** to add a **new instance** with **Add Object** -> Instance_ (_CTRL + 1_ in the Legacy Console), and select **WifiBulb RGB/w Discover**.

![Add Discovery Instance](img/create_discover.png?raw=true "Add Discovery Instance")

After setting up the Discovery instance, a list of available devices appears.

The device is green, if it has not been created yet.

![List](img/discover_list.png?raw=true "Devices found")

Now highlight the desired device and click on ** Create ** or ** Create All **, the instance will be created.

```
The instances created by the Discovery Module can be found in the object tree under:
IP-Symcon -> Wlan RGB/w devices
```
