# Magic Home Wifi LED
 
Modules for IP-Symcon from ** Version 5.2 ** to control the Magic Home Wifi RGB / w controller or compatible.

# Tested with
Magic Mini RGB / wifi Controller for LED Strip / Strip. Works with Alexa, Google Home, IFTTT, and Siri IR remote control, 16 million colors, 20 dynamic modes

# Manual
Currently the module is functional but unchecked or only with RGBW devices, see above, tested by me ;-)

``` `
TIP
Since the Wifi devices I know only support the 2G Wifi you have to set up the first time
Pay attention to the following with the Andoid / Apple APP:
If the 2G + 5G Wifi radio on the same SID should the 5G during the setup on the router
be disabled because otherwise there may be problems recognizing or setting up the Wifi device.
After setup, the 5G can easily be activated on the router again.
